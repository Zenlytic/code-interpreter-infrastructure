Reincorporate modules one at a time into `main.tf`, adding to `variables.tf` as needed.

Migration notes:
- To accommodate different naming conventions in AWS, we require ${var.prefix} to be
  more versatile. Namely, it should not end with a hyphen, so that we can choose the
  final separator on a case-by-case basis
- Instead of using a service account named "${var.prefix}infra-instances", we use an IAM
  profile named "${var.prefix}-infra-instances-service-profile" with various policies
  attached to a role named "${var.prefix}-infra-instances-service-role"
  - In accordance with this change, we output a "service_profile_name" and a
    "service_role_name"
  - One new policy that does not directly map to an old Google IAM role is the
    "ssm_read_policy". GCP automatically allows instances to access secrets, but AWS
    does not, so this makes up for the difference
